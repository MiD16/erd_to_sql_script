`ERD to Oracle Queries Converter`

This project converts ER diagrams from Draw.io into Oracle SQL queries (it can be scaled to convert to any other SQL language and even other frameworks like Laravel Eloquent).

Features include creating tables with constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY) and foreign key constraints.

Significantly reduces database setup time by aligning it with ERD design time.
